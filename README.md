Synopsis

The cohort is broken into two groups to complete a class project.  We were given an incomplete html document and css page.  We were to complete the page working in separate locations and not able to communicate except through our 'issue' statements via GitHub.



Code Example

Our page will have a header with a logo inside it.  The header should have active navigation buttons.  The body should contain a banner image, a carousel of the ten participants, and three photos with a caption.  The footer should have our social media links.



Motivation

We are to show competence in using GitHub 'issue' statements and linking those statements into the 'commit' portion.  We are to complete a web page as a group.



Installation

This project can be found on GitHub under FEE-SLC-2016 named tiy-slc-fee-2016.  Each of the ten cohort members worked on this project at some point.
